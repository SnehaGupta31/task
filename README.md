# Robust Distribution System for Fiat to USDC Conversion
The Fiat to USDC Conversion Service is a backend application designed to securely convert fiat currency to USDC on the Ethereum blockchain. Built with Express.js, MongoDB, and blockchain libraries like Web3.js and ethers.js, it handles user authentication, transaction logging, and automated USDC transfers. Users initiate deposits through RESTful API endpoints, and a scheduled cron job processes these transactions, executing USDC transfers from a treasury wallet to users' Ethereum addresses. With robust error handling and a retry mechanism for failed transactions, this service ensures reliable and secure currency conversions for users.
